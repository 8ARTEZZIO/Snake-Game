# AI Snake Game

This is a simple AI-driven Snake game written in Python. 
The snake autonomously navigates the grid, aiming to collect food and grow longer while avoiding collisions.
The project leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to structure and manage game logic efficiently.

## Features
- **AI Snake:** The snake plays by itself, autonomously seeking food and growing longer.
- **Object-Oriented Structure:** The game is organized using OOP principles to simplify game management and logic.
- **Expandable Codebase:** The code is organized to allow for easy future improvements, such as additional features or difficulty levels.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[yourusername]/Snake-Game.git
   cd Snake-Game

## Usage
The snake game starts automatically with the AI controlling the snake. The objective is for the snake to eat the food without colliding with itself or the walls.
